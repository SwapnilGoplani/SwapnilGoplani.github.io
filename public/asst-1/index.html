          <p> Currency will be the thing of the past.
            For the dollar bill won't always last
            Just like everything else, it will turn into dust.
            Gold, and silver it shall rust.
            Government empires will eventually fall.
            From the largest to the small.
            Worldly possessions shall be gone.
            Our only hope is Waka Flocka alone.</p>

            This is a web page. It was written by someone who wants to earn an A in his college web development class. This web page 
            contains more than div elements and images, it contains the dreams of those who have dared to dream despite
            never getting enough sleep, and it contains the hopes of those who have dared to hope against all hope. This web page
            represents man's unrelenting march towards revolution and the New World Order.
